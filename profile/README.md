   About The Adventure
</h2>
<p style="color:#b734eb";>
   There are Large-scale Events that affect all players involved, allowing for **dynamic changes** to the server itself based on choices made.
</p>
   
   Paired with a <p style="color:#eb3486";>Quest Format</p> that gives the player the feel of being a passenger of this world in which what you do has effects on it. This is special because there is no pre-determined quest path for any players since they **live in the present**.
   
   You will also experience our <p style="color:#eb7a34";>Custom Class System</p> where you can become bosses you kill and use their abilities/skills, place points in a class skill tree allowing you to play as whatever you want and even combining classes
   
   This also comes with a <p style="color:#24ab26";>Rewarding Exploration System</p> with plenty of unique locations to discover.  Learning about world lore has never been more fun, this also fulfills the needs of players who truly love exploring which is something we greatly care about!
   
   We also plan to add <p style="color:#3449eb";>Special Movement and Combat Mechanics</p> that will make gameplay that much more interesting
   
   To end, we put a large focus on <p style="color:#e6e202";>replayability</p> for players who want a second playthrough experience
